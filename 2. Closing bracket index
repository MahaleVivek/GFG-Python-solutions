Given a string with brackets ('[' and ']') and the index of an opening bracket. Find the index of the corresponding closing bracket.

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def closing (self,s, pos):
        # your code here
        d = deque() 
  
        for k in range(pos, len(s)): 
            # for every closing bracket 
            if s[k] == ']': 
                d.popleft() 
      
            # Push all starting brackets 
            elif s[k] == '[': 
                d.append(s[pos]) 
      
            # If deque becomes empty 
            if not d: 
                return k 
      
        return -1
     
     
Input:
#S = "[ABC[23]][89]"
#pos = 0
#Output: 8
#Explanation: [ABC[23]][89]
#The closing bracket corresponding to the opening bracket at index 0 is at index 8.
