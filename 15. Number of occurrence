Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

class Solution:

	def count(self,arr, n, x):
		# code here
		count = 0
		for i in range(0, n):
		    if arr[i] == x:
		        count += 1
		
		return count


#Input:
#N = 7, X = 2
#Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
#Output: 4
#Explanation: 2 occurs 4 times in the given array.
