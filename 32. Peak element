An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 

class Solution:   
    def peakElement(self,arr, n):
        # Code here
        if (n == 1) :
            return 0
        if (arr[0] >= arr[1]) :
            return 0
            
        if (arr[n - 1] >= arr[n - 2]) :
            return n - 1
  
        # check for every other element
        for i in range(1, n - 1) :
  
            # check if the neighbors are smaller
            if (arr[i] >= arr[i - 1] and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]) :
                return i


For Input: 
1
3
1 2 3

Your Output: 
1

Expected Output: 
1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 2
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.


Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {3,4}
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the 
peak element as it is greater than 
its only neighbour element 3.
