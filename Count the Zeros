Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's. The array is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed 
first and then they are followed by all the 0's. Find the count of all the 0's.

class Solution:
    def countZeroes(self, arr, n):
        # code here
        count = 0
        for i in range(0, n):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                count += 1
            
        return count

#Input:
#N = 12
#Arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}
#Output: 3
#Explanation: There are 3 0's in the given array.
