Given two strings S1 and S2 as input. Your task is to concatenate two strings and then reverse the string. Finally print the reversed string.

class Solution:
    def conRevstr (ob, S1, S2):
        # code here 
        ans = S1 + S2
        return ans[::-1]


#Input: S1 = "Geeks" , S2 = "forGeeks"
#Output: "skeeGrofskeeG" 
#Explanation: Concatenating S1 and S2 to get "GeeksforGeeks" then reversing it to "skeeGrofskeeG".
