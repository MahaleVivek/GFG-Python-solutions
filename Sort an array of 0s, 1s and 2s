Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

class Solution:
    def sort012(self,arr,n):
        # code here
        sort1 = arr.sort()
        
        return sort1


#Input: 
#N = 5
#arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
#Output:
#0 0 1 2 2
#Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
