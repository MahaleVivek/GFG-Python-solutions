Given a string without spaces, the task is to remove duplicates from it.

Note: The original order of characters must be kept the same.

class Solution:
	def removeDups(self, S):
		# code here
		result = []
        for c in S:
            if c not in result:
                result.append(c)
        result = ''.join(result)
        
        return result

#Input: S = "zvvo"
#Output: "zvo"
#Explanation: Only keep the first occurrence
