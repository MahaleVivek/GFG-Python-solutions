Given a list of N words. Count the number of words that appear exactly twice in the list.

class Solution:
    def countWords(self,List, n):
        #code here
        count = 0
        new_set = list(set(List))
        for i in range(len(new_set)):
            if List.count(new_set[i]) == 2:
                count += 1
            
        return count

#Input:
#N = 3
#list = {Geeks, For, Geeks}
#Output: 1
#Explanation: 'Geeks' is the only word that appears twice.
