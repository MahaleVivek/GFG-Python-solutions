Given an array arr of n elements which is first increasing and then may be decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
Note: If the array is increasing then just print then last element will be the maximum value.

class Solution:

	def findMaximum(self,arr, n):
		# code here
		number = max(arr)
		return number


#Input: 
#n = 9
#arr[] = {1,15,25,45,42,21,17,12,11}
#Output: 45
#Explanation: Maximum element is 45.
