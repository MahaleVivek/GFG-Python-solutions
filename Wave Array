Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

class Solution:
    #Complete this function
    #Function to sort the array into a wave-like array.
    def convertToWave(self,arr,N):
        #Your code here
        for i in range(0, N-1, 2):
            arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
            
        return arr
        
 
#Input:
#n = 5
#arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
#Output: 2 1 4 3 5
#Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in wave form are 2 1 4 3 5.
