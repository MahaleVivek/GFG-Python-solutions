Given an array arr of integers of length N, the task is to find whether it’s possible to construct 
an integer using all the digits of these numbers such that it would be divisible by 3. If it is 
possible then print “1” and if not print “0”.

class Solution:
    def isPossible(self, N, arr):
        # code here
        sum1 = 0
        i = 0
            
        sum1 = sum(arr)
            
        if((sum1 % 3) == 0):
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

#Input: N = 3
#arr = {40, 50, 90}
#Output: 1
#Explaination: One such number is 405900.
