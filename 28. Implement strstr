Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and  
locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns and integer denoting 
the first occurrence of the string x in s (0 based indexing).

#Function to locate the occurrence of the string x in the string s.
def strstr(s,x):
    #code here
    if x in s:
        return s.index(x)
    return -1
    
    
    
Example 1:

Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = Fr
Output: -1
Explanation: Fr is not present in the
string GeeksForGeeks as substring.


Example 2:

Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = For
Output: 5
Explanation: For is present as substring
in GeeksForGeeks from index 5 (0 based
indexing).
