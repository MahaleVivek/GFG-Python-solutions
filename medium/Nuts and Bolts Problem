Given a set of N nuts of different sizes and N bolts of different sizes. There is a one-one mapping between nuts and bolts. Match nuts and bolts efficiently.

Comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with nut to see which one is bigger/smaller.
The elements should follow the following order ! # $ % & * @ ^ ~ .


class Solution:

	def matchPairs(self,nuts, bolts, n):
		# code here
		symbols = ['!', "#", '$', '%', '&', '*', '@', '^', '~']
		
		new_set = []
		
		for element in symbols:
		    if element in nuts:
		        new_set.append(element)
		        
        for i in range(n):
            nuts[i], bolts[i] = new_set[i], new_set[i]


#Input: 
#N = 5
#nuts[] = {@, %, $, #, ^}
#bolts[] = {%, @, #, $ ^}
Output: 
# $ % @ ^
# $ % @ ^
