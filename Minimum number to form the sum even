Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to add the minimum number(should be greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of the array becomes even

class Solution:
    def minNum(self, arr, n):
        # Your code goes here
        self.arr = arr
        self.n = n
        sum1 = 0
        for i in range(n):
            sum1 += arr[i]
            
        if sum1 % 2 == 0:
            return 2
        else:
            return 1


#Input: N = 8
#arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
#Output:  2
#Explanation:  Sum of array is 36, so we add minimum number 2 to make the sum even.
